# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 - My Journey! 🎅

Welcome to my cozy little repository where I tackle the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) with curiosity and a cup of hot cocoa! ☕✨

## 🌟 What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual event filled with daily programming puzzles that appear every day from December 1st to December 25th. It’s a delightful mix of logic, algorithms, and festive fun, designed to challenge and inspire developers of all skill levels. Each day, we unravel a new piece of a whimsical holiday story! 🎁

## ✨ About This Repo
This repository is my personal playground for solving and documenting each puzzle from Advent of Code 2024. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Daily Solutions:** Organized by day and part (e.g., `day3/p1`, `day3/p2`, etc.). Each folder contains my lovingly crafted solutions.
- **Code Experiments:** Some side explorations where I try out new approaches or optimize my solutions.
- **Notes & Learnings:** Little snippets of wisdom I pick up along the way.

## 📜 Structure
